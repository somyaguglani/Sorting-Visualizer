## SORTING VISUALIZER ##
Welcome to the Sorting Visualizer ! I have made this application because algorithms in general fascinate me . So why not build something that can actually show someone what actually happens behind the scenes?
The application does exactly that and you can check it here ....

### Meet The Algorithms ###

#### Bubble Sort #### 
Bubble sort, sometimes referred to as sinking sort, is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.

#### Merge Sort #### 
Merge sort works as follows:
Divide the unsorted list into n sublists, each containing one element (a list of one element is considered sorted).
Repeatedly merge sublists to produce new sorted sublists until there is only one sublist remaining. This will be the sorted list.

#### Quick Sort #### 
It works by selecting a 'pivot' element from the array and partitioning the other elements into two sub-arrays, according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot. The sub-arrays are then sorted recursively. This can be done in-place, requiring small additional amounts of memory to perform the sorting.

#### Heap Sort #### 
Heapsort divides its input into a sorted and an unsorted region, and it iteratively shrinks the unsorted region by extracting the largest element from it and inserting it into the sorted region.
